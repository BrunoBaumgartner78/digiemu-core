# Ethics Framework – DigiEmu Core

DigiEmu Core is designed as epistemic infrastructure. Its purpose is to improve traceability, not to centralize authority.

## Ethical Commitments

- No hidden decision logic
- No opaque data mutation
- No intentional manipulation of knowledge state
- Explicit version traceability
- Transparent boundary of responsibility

## AI Integration Principle

DigiEmu Core does not generate knowledge.
It structures and stabilizes knowledge used by AI systems.

Responsibility for AI outputs remains with system integrators.

## Responsible Use

The system must not be used for:

- Covert surveillance
- Undocumented behavioral manipulation
- Suppression of traceable knowledge changes

Ethical violations justify termination of commercial licensing.
