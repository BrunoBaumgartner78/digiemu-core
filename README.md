# DigiEmu Core

DigiEmu Core is an auditable knowledge kernel designed to stabilize AI-driven systems through versioned claims, structured governance, and traceable decision logic.

It is not a chatbot framework.  
It is not a CMS.  
It is not an application layer.  

It is infrastructure.

---

## Purpose

Modern AI systems lack reproducibility, version stability and epistemic traceability. DigiEmu Core introduces a structured knowledge layer that enables:

- Versioned claims
- Deterministic content history
- Audit trails
- Explicit governance rules
- Decision logging

The system is designed for environments where traceability and reproducibility are essential (education, research, regulated industries, AI governance).

---

## Architectural Principles

- Separation of domain logic from infrastructure
- Explicit versioning at claim level
- Immutable historical states
- Deterministic decision logging
- Strict boundary between Open Core and commercial extensions

---

## Open Core Scope

The Open Core includes:

- Kernel architecture
- Domain model (Tenant, Content, Claim, Version)
- Core API ports
- Governance documentation
- Decision log structure
- Ethics and abort criteria framework

---

## Commercial Extensions (Not Included)

The following components are not part of the Open Core:

- Enterprise multi-tenant layer
- License activation mechanisms
- Compliance add-ons
- SLA / support modules
- Commercial audit tooling

These components are available under separate commercial licensing.

---

## Status

DigiEmu Core is released as Open Core infrastructure under the Business Source License (BSL 1.1).

It is intended for controlled adoption, academic validation and responsible system integration.

---

## Non-Goals

DigiEmu Core does not:

- Replace application frameworks
- Provide conversational AI
- Offer UI components
- Replace data storage engines

It provides epistemic infrastructure only.

---

## Governance

Development follows explicit governance principles defined in:

- GOVERNANCE.md
- ETHICS.md
- ABORT_CRITERIA.md
