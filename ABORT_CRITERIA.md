# Abort Criteria – DigiEmu Core

DigiEmu Core defines explicit structural abort conditions to prevent misuse or epistemic degradation.

## Immediate Abort Conditions

Development or deployment must be halted if:

1. Version determinism is intentionally bypassed.
2. Audit trails are suppressed or manipulated.
3. Governance documentation is removed or ignored.
4. Hidden state mutation is introduced.
5. Commercial pressure compromises architectural integrity.

## Commercial Abort Clause

The Licensor reserves the right to terminate commercial licensing if the system is used in violation of the defined ethical framework.

## Principle

Infrastructure must remain trustworthy.
If trust cannot be preserved, deployment must stop.
