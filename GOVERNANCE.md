# Governance Model – DigiEmu Core

DigiEmu Core follows a controlled infrastructure governance model.

## Core Principles

1. Architectural Stability over Feature Expansion
2. Epistemic Integrity over Growth
3. Deterministic Versioning
4. Explicit Decision Logging
5. Clear Boundary between Open and Commercial Layers

## Contribution Policy

All contributions must:

- Preserve domain separation
- Respect version determinism
- Avoid introducing hidden state
- Avoid coupling to commercial modules

Pull requests are reviewed for architectural alignment, not feature quantity.

## Release Policy

- Semantic versioning
- Tagged releases only
- No silent changes to domain logic
- Decision log entry required for structural modifications

## Governance Authority

Final architectural authority remains with the Licensor to ensure coherence and long-term integrity.
